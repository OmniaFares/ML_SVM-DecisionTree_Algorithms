# ML_SVM-DecisionTree_Algorithms

### Implementation of Machine learning SVM & Decision Tree ALgorithms.  

### 1. [SVM Algorithm](https://github.com/nadahkhaledd/ML_SVM-DecisionTree_Algorithms/blob/master/SVM/algorithmSVM.py)

> #### Libraries Used:
> - Numpy
> - Pandas  


> #### Steps:
> - Read data
> - Split data into Train & Test
> - Generate combination of different features from data
> - Normalize data
> - Calculate gradient descent
> - Calculate Accuracy of algorithm
> - Try different learning rates
> - Get best features found with their accuracy for each alpha trial

### 2. [Decision Tree Algorithm](https://github.com/nadahkhaledd/ML_SVM-DecisionTree_Algorithms/blob/master/DecisionTree/algorithmDT.py)

> #### Libraries Used:
> - Numpy
> - Pandas  


> #### Steps:
> - Read data
> - Split data into Train & Test
> - Build Tree
> - Calculate Entropy & Information Gain
> - Get best split of tree 
> - Try with new data to test prediction accuracy
